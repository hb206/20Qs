# 20Qs CS Assignment using biary trees
Game begins with user thinking of an object. Computer will try to guess your object by asking you a series of yes or no questions.  Eventually the computer will have asked enough questions that it thinks it knows what object you are thinking of.  It will make a guess about what your object is.  If this guess is correct, the computer wins; if not, you win.

Initially the program will not be very interactive. Program grows more intelligent/learns from user each time it loses a game.  If the computer's answer guess is incorrect, you must give it a new question it can ask to help it in future games.
